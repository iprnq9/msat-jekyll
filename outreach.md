### Outreach

The role of our M-SAT Outreach is to excite grades K-12 about the wonders of space and engage youth in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields at a young age with the hopes that they pursue an education that will help to perpetuate our society and keep us pushing the limitations of humankind. Each event is different, but all have an emphasis on space-related topics. Different activities include: local school visits and presentations about rocket science, hands-on electronics demonstrations, rocket building, assisting in the earning of space exploration merit badges, demonstrations of flight simulators and wind tunnels, and much more.

We understand that the youth of today are the scientists, leaders, and engineers of tomorrow, and want to play a role in fostering a passion for space exploration and advancement.
