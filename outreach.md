### Outreach

The role of our M-SAT Outreach is to excite grades K-12 about science, and engage children at a young age in science, technology, and math. Events have a strong emphasis on space related topics.

Typically team members visit local schools to present on topics such as elementary rocket science, and lead children in hands-on activities. Outreach has also developed relationships with various schools and interface with their existing programs on an individual basis.
