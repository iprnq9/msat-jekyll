### Welcome

M-SAT (Missouri S&T Satellite Research Team) is a research group located at Missouri S&T. M-SAT is
dedicated to designing, building, and flying small satellites. While it serves as the space-oriented senior
design, it is also made up of graduate and undergraduates students of all majors. There are currently two
primary missions that are being undertaken by the team: MR & MRS SAT with Nanosat-8 and APEX
with Nanosat-9. The team is also working on other cubesat missions, and supports the efforts of Miners in Space
team. M-SAT operates out of the SSE lab in Toomey 315.
