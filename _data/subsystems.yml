  description: |
    The command and data handling subsystem is the brains of the satellite, controlling what the spacecraft does, when it does it, and why it is doing it. It is responsible for data operations and issuing commands to multiple systems aboard the spacecraft. It also controls the decision making capabilities of the spacecraft, as all data that are needed for any function of the satellite pass through this system. Without a command and data handling subsystem, the spacecraft would not function at all.

    In order to communicate with all of the various circuit boards and sensors on the MR & MRS SAT spacecraft, the Command and Data Handling system makes use of multiple data buses. On MRS SAT, the central computer communicates over two UART data buses. On MR SAT, the flight computer conducts most communication through an I2C bus. Some sensors on MR SAT
    require specific forms of communication; the IMU is connected to the
    flight computer via an SPI bus, and the Imaging Computer is connected to the flight computer with an ethernet cable. Thermal sensors are
    connected directly to the flight computer with a 1-Wire bus. The Command and Data Handling system is able to issue commands and receive data to and from each system using a variety of data buses.

- title: 'Communications'
  nickname: 'COM'
  url: 'communications'
  description: |
    The communications system of a spacecraft is one of the most critical pieces of hardware. The communication system of any modern satellite is responsible for any data sent to and from said satellite. Without the communication system, a satellite essentially becomes space debris. Failure of the communications
    system will almost always cause mission failure for nearly any satellite regardless of the state of any other system. Alternatively, failure of the communications system to process communications received by the satellite could stall or end a mission, as the satellite fails to receive vital instructions. In the interests of mission success, it is critical that the ability for the satellite to receive and especially transmit information be maintained. The nature of the small satellite community also means that it is important that the communication system be both low-cost and reliable.

    The MR & MRS SAT spacecraft requires two separate communication systems, as there is no data link between the two craft post-separation. The MR SAT communication system utilizes two radios to facilitate a full-duplex connection with the ground. The two radios used operate on the UHF and VHF amateur radio bands. Using a full-duplex system prevents any accidental transmitter locks by allowing a reset command to be sent to the satellite at any time during ground connection. The MRS SAT spacecraft utilizes a radio that communicates with the GlobalStar network to allow for simplex communication to the ground. MRS SAT's primary purpose is to simulate a non-cooperative resident space object (RSO) or space debris. The nal component of the communication system is the ground station. A ground station is required to receive telemetry and send commands to the satellite.

- title: 'Guideance, Navigation, & Control'
  nickname: 'GNC'
  url: 'guidance-navigation-control'
  description: |
    The guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) subsystem is responsible for creating a navigation solution for a satellite. GNC must be able to process the sensor data that is provided by sensing equipment such as an inertial measurement unit, magnetometer, Sun sensors, and GPS, and use these data to control the movement of the satellite and keep the attitude and trajectory within reasonable bounds.

    The GNC system of MR & MRS SAT is accountable for the processing of information received from the different sensors and commanding the twelve cold-gas thrusters and three torque coils onboard. The inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based navigation filter processes the internal and external sensor data to provide the estimated position, velocity, and attitude of MR SAT, as well as the relative position and velocity of MRS SAT with respect to MR SAT. Once these have been determined, a series of algorithms determine what course of action needs to be taken, and what kind of attitude adjustments need to be made. The twelve thrusters and three torque coils allow for the spacecraft to have a full six degree-of-freedom control.

  description: |
    The purspose of the integration subsystem is to bring together all the subsystems. Each subsystem has different technologies and ideas, and these must be compatible with the overall design of the satellite. Integration also verifies that the design parameters and program requirement are met. Finally, complete assembly of the satellites is done to make sure the satellite actually fits together properly.  Since assembly of the satellite is performed in a clean room, Integration exchanges the clean room suits twice a semester.

- title: 'Power'
  url: 'power'
  description: |
    The objective of the power subsystem is to acquire, store, and distribute power to a spacecraft in order to maintain the functionality of that spacecraft throughout the duration of its mission. The Electrical Power System (EPS) must be able to generate power, usually through the usage of solar panels, store that energy, and regulate it so that it is distributed in such a manner that will not harm any of the components of the satellite. Each of the major components of the EPS are determined by the requirements of the rest of the components of the satellite that use power and that availability of power to the satellite on its proposed orbit.

- title: 'Propulsion'
  url: 'propulsion'
  description: |
    The propulsion subsystem is necessary to generate thrust and make adjustments to both the satellite’s trajectory and its attitude. A general propulsion system will use a propellant tank, plumbing, control devices, and nozzles or thrusters to provide the necessary thrust for a given satellite’s mission. A propulsion system is critical to ensure that the spacecraft has maneuverability while in its orbit, and can make necessary adjustments to correct any anomalies that may occur during deployment or later stages of flight.

    Nanosat-8 utilizes a novel cold-gas propulsion system that, when it was initially designed, was a pioneer in its field. The choice to use a cold-gas was decided mainly on the fact that the traditional methods (Hydrazine) were too dangerous, and an alternative, safer approach was desired. The propellant chosen to satisfy this requirement was R-134a, a common household refrigerant, that was readily available, inexpensive, and provided adequate theoretical results for what was required of the spacecraft.

    Nanosat-9’s primary payload will be the propulsion system, which will utilize an innovative multi-mode configuration with a single monopropellant that has the ability to toggle between chemical combustion and electric propulsion. This type of system would allow for much more mission capability and flexibility while in orbit.

- title: 'Stereoscopic Imaging'
  nickname: 'SI'
  url: 'steroscopic-imaging'
  description: |
    Stereoscopic Imaging (SI) is a subsystem that is unique to the Nanosat-8 Project. The SI system utilizes two cameras mounted on the top surface of MR SAT which are used nearly-simultaneously to help guide MR SAT through its orbit and stay focused on a Resident Space Object (RSO), which is MRS SAT in this case. A stereoscopic imaging layout is similar to the human eye, in that it takes input from two different sources and helps determine relative distance from the body. MR SAT will be using the cameras to take pictures of MRS SAT after separation, combine those images using a Simulink algorithm utilizing an onboard computer, and then calculate angles with the objective of keeping MRS SAT in plain view of MR SAT at all times. A secondary objective of this subsystem is to take numerous photographs of the RSO during the circumnavigation mission mode of MR SAT and use those images to produce a 3-dimensional reconstruction of that RSO. An advantageous aspect of this system is that it requires low amounts of power and is a passive sensor, meaning that an RSO cannot detect that MR SAT is sensing it, as opposed to active sensors such as RADAR and LIDAR.

- title: 'Structures'
  url: 'structures'
  description: |
    The structures subsystem deals with the load-bearing body of the spacecraft. A sturdy structural design with sufficient capacity to carry all necessary components is essential to a spacecraft's mission success. It is also essential to limit the mass and size of the spacecraft in order to lower the costs associated with placing it in orbit. These primary constraints drive the overall structural design of most spacecraft. The structures subsystem analyzes the design of the frame of the spacecraft utilizing Finite Element Analysis software to ensure that it meets these requirements and remains structurally sound during different phases of the mission, including transport, launch, deployment, and orbit.

    Nanosat-8 is categorized as a microsatellite, so it must have a total mass of less than 50 kg, and must also fit within a 50 x 50 x 60 cm volume. MR SAT is a hexagonal satellite, chosen because of the ease of manufacturability over an octagonal satellite, and the benefits that the hexagonal satellite provides over a standard cubic satellite in terms of space available and surface area available facing the sun that could be used for solar panels. The majority of the structure will be made out of honeycomb isogrid aluminum panels that provides strength, accessibility and connection points for components, and is a lightweight alternative to a solid panel.

    Nanosat-9 is proposed to be a 6U CubeSat that must be less than 12 kg in total mass, where a U is a 10 x 10 x 10 cm unit of volume, so 6U is approximately the size of a shoebox. The frame of the APEX satellite is a proprietary design created by Pumpkin, Inc.

  description: |
    The Thermal subsystem is responsible for providing adequate thermal protection for the satellite during all mission phases. To ensure that the temperature sensitive components will not be harmed during the mission, the thermal subsystem is also responsible for analyzing and simulating the heat and energy sources that the satellite will encounter throughout the mission. The driving constraints for the design of the thermal system include hardware operational temperatures, structural material optical properties, spacecraft flight altitude, and spacecraft internal energy generation.
