    The goals of the MR & MRS SAT project are to test new technologies in support of missions involving proximity operations,
    including the study of an R-134a-based cold gas propulsion system for use in formation flying applications and the development of a
    stereoscopic imager sensor used to determine the real-time relative position/velocity vectors between the satellite pair. Data obtained during
    the close formation flight phase of MR & MRS SAT will be evaluated for the benefit of future missions. Through the Lunar Derby, M-SAT also
    plans on overcoming the significant technological challenges of sending a cubesat to lunar orbit. As a result of the modest budget that accompanies a university level project; M-SAT requires the use of innovative, low-cost solutions to meet these objectives.

    The M-SAT Team was accepted into the Nanosat-8 student competition in December 2012 with an official start date of January 2013. Nanosat-8 was
    sponsored by the Air Force and required that the team's spacecraft be completed by January 2015 for a final competition review with nine other
    universities. At the review in January 2015, the M-SAT team was awarded first place.

    APEX (Advanced Propulsion Experiment) is apart of the next iteration of the USAF Research Labâ€™s
    University Nanosat Program, or Nanosat-9. M-SAT joined Nanosat-9 in January of 2016. APEX is to
    be a 3U satellite that will perform several orbital maneuvers in LEO, demonstrating a new multi-mode
    propulsion system that is being developed by a professor at Missouri S&T. While MR & MRS SAT are
    currently in Phase B of the Nanosat program, and thus are technically out of competition, APEX is just
    starting Phase A and is in direct competition with many other leading universities across the United
    States.

    The Undergraduate Student Instrument Project (USIP) is a part of the NASA Science Mission Directorate intended to challenge US universities to develop their technical and project management skills. The Multi-Mode Mission M&sup3; project will integrate the experimental thruster, being developed by the Missouri S&T Advanced Plasma Lab, into a 3U CubeSat structure in order to get in-flight performance data. The project is working towards it's Preliminary Design Review in April.
