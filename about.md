### Who we are
We are the Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T) satellite research team (M-SAT). M-SAT works in conjunction with a number of AFRL/NASA/industry mentors to design, construct, and launch small satellites. We are currently actively working on two projects; MR/MRS SAT and Cube Quest. The first project consists of two microsatellites, named MR SAT (Missouri-Rolla Satellite) and MRS SAT (Missouri-Rolla Second Satellite). The pair is launched together, and MR SAT will act as an inspector satellite while MRS SAT will simulate an uncooperative resident space object (RSO), with the two performing proximity operations during their flight. The second project, Cube Quest, is a part of NASA's Centennial Challenge Program. The team will be designing, constructing, and hopefully launching a cubesat about the size of a shoe box that will participate in NASA's Lunar Derby competition, where the ultimate goal is to orbit the Moon.

The goals of the MR/MRS SAT project are to test new technologies in support of missions involving proximity operations, including the study of an R-134a-based cold gas propulsion system for use in formation flying applications and the development of a stereoscopic imager sensor used to determine the real-time relative position/velocity vectors between the satellite pair. Data obtained during the close formation flight phase of MR/MRS SAT will be evaluated for the benefit of future missions. Through the Lunar Derby, M-SAT also plans on overcoming the significant technological challenges of sending a cubesat to lunar orbit. As a result of the modest budget that accompanies a university level project; M-SAT requires the use of innovative, low-cost solutions to meet these objectives.

The M-SAT Team was accepted into the Nanosat-8 student competition in December 2012 with an official start date of January 2013. Nanosat-8 was sponsored by the Air Force and required that the team's spacecraft be completed by January 2015 for a final competition review with nine other universities. At the review in January 2015, the M-SAT team was awarded first place.

The M-SAT team will compete in the upcoming Ground Tournament for the Cube Quest Challenge in August 2015. If successful, M-SAT will continue designing and building the cubesat.

M-SAT is composed of undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. The design and construction of M-SAT is a valuable educational experience for the student's on the team. The project provides the experience of using a team approach and principles of systems engineering to enable a fundamental understanding of the spacecraft design, integration, test, and fly process. The approach used in conducting this project is to emulate industry as closely as possible. In this approach students gain an understanding of engineering ethics along with significant experience in written and oral communication.

### Our Mission
#### Mission
The purpose of the MR & MRS SAT mission is to provide flight testing of a stereoscopic imaging system to successfully track an uncooperative resident space object and use a propulsion system developed at Missouri S&T with R-134a refrigerant as the propellant to fly the pair of satellites in specified formations.

#### Primary Mission Objectives
* Successfully track MRS SAT using stereoscopic imaging
* Utilize R-134a-based propulsion system for satellite translational and attitude control

#### Technology Demonstrations
* Stereoscopic imaging system designed in-house
* Refrigerant-based cold gas propulsion system
